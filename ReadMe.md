## Motivation
Despite advancements in car safety and infrastructure, road accidents remain a leading cause of death among youth and young adults. This project seeks to improve urban living conditions and save lives by transforming road safety with AI.

## Objective
This project aims to develop a Neural Network (NN) model that predicts and detects road accidents before they occur. The model is designed to learn from video scenes and identify early-stage accident patterns, contributing significantly to the goal of zero road deaths through AI.

## Pipeline

The project follows a pipeline of
feature extraction â†’ data preprocessing â†’ accident prediction.

## Description 

we utilized the [car crash dataset (CCD)](https://github.com/Cogito2012/CarCrashDataset) for the analysis of accidents and non-accidents. In order to extract features from the videos within the dataset, the YOLOv9-e model from ultralytics was employed for object detection. It was observed that the model required fine-tuning specifically for the detection of transportation objects from a dashcam viewpoint to align with the objects present in the car crash dataset and to efficiently detect objects. The [vehicle orientation dataset](https://github.com/sekilab/VehicleOrientationDataset/tree/main) was utilized for the fine-tuning of the YOLOv9 model due to its inclusion of object orientations which served as a crucial feature for the model to learn motion patterns during the analysis of video frames. Subsequently, the YOLO model was employed to analyze the CCD videos and extract features and Data was preprocessed and organized into sequences for training the LSTM and GRU models, built using keras for early accident detection.

## Recommendations for Further Work

These are some suggestions for future enhancements and contributions to elevate this project.

- Employ advanced techniques for data sampling from datasets to reduce class imbalance.

- Enhance feature detection and extraction from video frames and include new features such as (traffic lights, car backlights, and street lanes).

- Explore the application of Transformer models for prediction tasks due to their exceptional known performance in capturing long-range dependencies.

- Develop a multi-class accident categorization system that categorizes accidents based on various factors such as (high speed, weather conditions, and aggressive driving) and offers personalized driver recommendations instead of general warning.

These proposed directions underscore our commitment to refining our approach and enhancing model performance, contributing significantly to traffic safety solutions.
